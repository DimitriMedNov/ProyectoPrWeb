                <h2>It's not just a Taco<br>It's <span>El Taquito Gordo Feliz taqueria</span></h2>
                <p>El Taquito Gordo Feliz is a taqueria that has been in operation for the past three years. It was founded by D'mitri Medina Novelo and William Moran Ramirez, who are the owners and operators of the business.
                    The story of El Taquito Gordo Feliz began when D'mitri and William met in college and became friends. They shared a love of Mexican food and had noticed a lack of authentic options in their area.
                    They decided to team up to open their own taqueria, with the intention of bringing the authentic Mexican food experience to their community. They spent months working on the concept, developing the menu, and searching for the perfect location.
                    They finally found a small space that was perfect for their business. They renovated it and decorated it with a cheerful and colorful style that reflected Mexican culture.
                    El Taquito Gordo Feliz's menu features a wide variety of options, from traditional carne asada and al pastor tacos to vegetarian and vegan options. They also offer a selection of Mexican beverages, such as horchata and agua de jamaica.
                    Since opening three years ago, El Taquito Gordo Feliz has been a success in their local community. Customers have praised the authenticity of the food and the welcoming and fun atmosphere of the taqueria.
                    D'mitri and William are very proud of their business and hope to continue serving delicious tacos and spreading Mexican culture in their community for many years to come.</p>
